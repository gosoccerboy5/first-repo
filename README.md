## Anyone who somehow, somewhy* cares about developing this repo locally
I'm using [this VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeffalo.lived) that immediately sets up a localhost server. If you're using vanilla file:/// URIs to open .html files, it's almost certainly not going to work, besides displaying the bare HTML. I recommend you use that extension, or some other way to open up a localhost server.
