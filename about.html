    <h1>About Me, gosoccerboy5</h1>
    <p>Hello. I'm gosoccerboy5. You can call me, well, gosoccerboy5 (unless you know my real name, which would be creepy).
    </p>
    <p>
    I started my coding journey in 2015, on a website you may know, called <a href = "//scratch.org">Scratch</a> Back then, I was little. It was really my <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/collinrocket/">brother</a> who introduced me to Scratch and thus coding.
    </p><p>
    I loved Scratch a whole lot, and I played a lot with it, along with my friends. However, I didn't really get into coding until around 5 years on Scratch, where I decided to get off my butt and try new things. I already had a Khan Academy account, so I started taking Khan Academy's Javascript/processing.js courses. Best choice of my <s>life</s> CS career up til then.
    </p><p>
    Obviously, that was far from the whole of Javascript. I was also constantly learning from other sources on the web. After a while, I decided to take Khan Academy's manipulating the DOM courses. Next best choice of my CS career so far. That really opened my eyes up to Javascript and programming - it was no longer a toy, but a powerful tool that could be used to build large things.
    </p><p>
    Since then, I've recently learned a whole lot, such as new programming languages with different concepts, and using Github which will no doubt be a large factor in my CS career.
