            <s>I use <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/download/thanks/">Firefox</a>. It has great developer tools and UI.</s> Sad update as of July 6, 2021. I am using Google Chrome right now because Firefox was using a lot of memory. I use Apple Macbooks, mainly because I don't have Windows computers, but I certainly love the UI on Macbooks.
