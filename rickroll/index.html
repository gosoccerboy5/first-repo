    <title>Rickrolling people unsuspectingly</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello! Looks like you want to rickroll people?</h1>
    <h2>Well, you're in luck!</h2>
    This code allows you to rickroll people with HTML, but in a super-secret unsuspecting way.<br>
    To use it, just copy this script tag (you can click on it to select it).
    <br>
    <textarea id = "code" readonly = "true">&lt;script src = "https://gosoccerboy5.github.io/rickroll/rickroll.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</textarea>
    <br>
    Then, just add 'class = "rickroll"' to any link you want to be a rickroll.
    <br>
    <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu" class = "rickroll" title = "Note how the link apparently directs to Scratch.">Demo</a>
    <script src = "../resources/index.js" onload="reference('../')"></script>
    <script src = "rickroll.js"></script>
    <script>
      document.querySelector("#code").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        document.querySelector("#code").select();
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
